Retired Green Beret arrested on Capitol siege charge (2021)
-----------------------------------------------------------
**News articles:**

- `Former Special Forces soldier and onetime congressional candidate 
  arrested in Capitol riot case (2021) 
  <https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2021/10/02/jeremy-brown-capitol-riot-arrest/>`_ [washingtonpost]

Some people that uses the encrypted instant messaging app `Signal 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_(software)>`_ have a false sense 
of security that anything they write on the app will forever remain 
private between the concerned users. 

However as this case shows, if only one of the members of the chat group 
cooperate with the authorities by revealing the encrypted messages, then 
it doesn't matter that you are using the most advanced encrypted texting 
app in the world.

If a member of a chat group on Signal (or from any other encrypted messaging
app like Telegram) uses very weak security on their phone (easy or no 
password) and `they locally saved lots of screenshots of conversations 
from Signal <https://www.reddit.com/r/signal/comments/l0jqc0/can_you_block_others_from_taking_a_screenshot_of/>`_, 
then you better pray that they don't loose their phone.

Do you trust the members of your chat group with sensitive information?

Maybe the kids show from the 80's, `Inspector Gadget <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inspector_Gadget_(1983_TV_series)>`_, 
had it right: if you need to plan an important mission, then 
communication between associates should be done in person through 
self-destruct papers.
