Criminals Using Strong Security Software
========================================
**Disclaimer:** the analysis of the following cases are for informational 
purposes. Don't use it to break the law.

You will find in this analysis of criminals using strong security software
that they were caught not because a huge vulnerability was found right in 
the software but because the criminals wrongly used these programs.

The average users that use these security software for legitimate uses need 
to also learn how to use them so they don't complain about the supposedly 
lack of security from these programs if sensitive information about their 
private lives leaked.

Retired Green Beret arrested on Capitol siege charge (2021)

Some people that use the encrypted instant messaging app `Signal 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_(software)>`_ have a false sense 
of security that anything they write on the app will forever remain 
private between the concerned users. 

However as this case shows, if only one of the members of the chat group 
cooperate with the authorities by revealing the encrypted messages, then 
it doesn't matter that you are using the most advanced encrypted texting 
app in the world.

 Implementing the latest most advanced equipment and security safeguards 
 are to no avail if all the users are not properly trained to be part of 
 the security plan.

Also, even if you only communicated with people that you have high
confidence that they are loyal to you, at the end of the day everyone
has their price. Worse if you live in a repressed regime where `torture 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber-hose_cryptanalysis>`_ is commonly 
practiced by the authorities to extract sensitive information, 
then people will quickly reveal the contents of the encrypted conversations 
to save themselves. In more liberal countries, they won't beat you but 
they will use psychological abuse which can be as effective as torture to
get important information.

If members of a chat group on Signal (or from any other encrypted messaging
app like Telegram) use very weak security on their phone (easy or no 
password) and `they locally saved lots of screenshots of conversations 
from Signal <https://www.reddit.com/r/signal/comments/l0jqc0/can_you_block_others_from_taking_a_screenshot_of/>`_, 
then you better pray that they don't loose their phones.

Do you trust the members of your chat group with sensitive information?

Maybe the kids show from the 80's, `Inspector Gadget <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inspector_Gadget_(1983_TV_series)>`_, 
had it right: if you need to plan a friend's surprise birthday, then 
communication between associates should be done in person through 
self-destruct papers.

Harvard Bomb Hoax (2013)
------------------------
**News articles:**

- `How Tor helped catch the Harvard bomb threat suspect (2013)
  <https://www.dailydot.com/unclick/tor-harvard-bomb-suspect/>`_ [dailydot]
- `Why TOR failed to hide the bomb hoaxer at Harvard (2013) <https://theprivacyblog.com/blog/anonymity/why-tor-failed-to-hide-the-bomb-hoaxer-at-harvard>`_ [theprivacyblog]

Everything you do online even if you do it while connected to Tor can 
be eventually correlated to unmask you.

This is basically how the Harvard bomb hoaxer might have been caught. The
affidavit doesn't provide much details on how the student was actually 
caught. But we can read between the lines to determine how he might have
been caught without the authorities needing to compromise the Tor network.

The student connected to Tor through the University's WiFi network and
then sent the threatening emails. By not using a remote network, important
information about his computer and himself (e.g. MAC address, his full 
name since you need to authenticate with your campus ID to access the 
school's WiFi network) was logged into Harvard University's server logs.

The timestamps from the school's logs and the emails were certainly 
correlated to suggest strongly him being the author of the bomb threats 
and also the fact that not many people used Tor on campus, so the number 
of suspects was probably very low. We need to also consider 
the student succumbing to fear of having majorly screwed up his life and 
confessing right away to the police, looking for a plea bargain.

Thus, the security of Tor was definitely not at fault in this case. 
The student did not know how to adequately use Tor and this is what 
allowed the police to unmask him.

Tor is a powerful anonymizer but since it is part of a much complex 
ecosystem, you must know how to use it to avoid your personal 
information being leaked to the outside world.
