Retired Green Beret arrested on Capitol siege charge (2021)

 In modern cryptosystems, the weakest link is often the human user

Some people that use the encrypted instant messaging app `Signal 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_(software)>`_ have a false sense 
of security that anything they write on the app will forever remain 
private between the concerned users. 

However as this case shows, if only one of the members of the chat group 
cooperate with the authorities by revealing the encrypted messages, then 
it doesn't matter that you are using the most advanced encrypted texting 
app in the world.

 Implementing the latest most advanced equipment and security safeguards 
 are to no avail if all the users are not properly trained to be part of 
 the security plan.

Also, even if you only communicated with people that you have high
confidence that they are loyal to you, at the end of the day everyone
has their price. Worse if you live in a repressed regime where `torture 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber-hose_cryptanalysis>`_ is commonly 
practiced by the authorities to extract sensitive information, 
then people will quickly reveal the contents of the encrypted conversations 
to save themselves. In more liberal countries, they won't beat you but 
they will use psychological abuse which can be as effective as torture to
get important information.

If members of a chat group on Signal (or from any other encrypted messaging
app like Telegram) use very weak security on their phone (easy or no 
password) and `they locally saved lots of screenshots of conversations 
from Signal <https://www.reddit.com/r/signal/comments/l0jqc0/can_you_block_others_from_taking_a_screenshot_of/>`_, 
then you better pray that they don't loose their phones.

Do you trust the members of your chat group with sensitive information?

Maybe the kids show from the 80's, `Inspector Gadget <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inspector_Gadget_(1983_TV_series)>`_, 
had it right: if you need to plan a friend's surprise birthday, then 
communication between associates should be done in person through 
self-destruct papers.
