.. Methods to be anonymous
.. Tips to follow to avoid being easily identified

Be super paranoid
=================
This state of mind might be overkill but will eventually protect your 
anonymity as much as possible.

Tor settings
============
Prioritze .onion sites when known
---------------------------------
For instance, when connecting to your *proton.me* account.

Use the safest security level
-----------------------------
 Safest: Only allows website features required for static sites and basic services. These changes affect images, media, and scripts.
 
Your web experiene will tremendously suffer but your anonymity will be super protected.

Master level tips
=================
Don't login to your personal accounts (e.g. email, social media)
----------------------------------------------------------------

Don't readily open any file (e.g. PDF, pictures, videos) no matter who sent it
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you need to open the file, do it on a controlled computer where the **WiFi is turned off.** Then
check the file with a packet analyzer (e.g. Wireshark) by looking if it tries to communicate 
with the outside world. If it does, you dodged a bullet but then the fun begins to investigate
the malicious file and sender.

**Important tip:** open a file only when you are not connected to the internet.

Don't upload any file (e.g. photos, videos)
-------------------------------------------
If you still have to upload a file, then check it for any metadata (e.g. GPS locations, author) 
that might uniquely identify you. Remove these metadata before sending the file.

Don't write (e.g. emails, tweets) too personal
----------------------------------------------

Avoid tracking software, especially anything Google-related
-----------------------------------------------------------
Avoid anything that Google produces like the plague! Of course, they
are not the only ones you need to absolutely avoid when using
Tor but they are the worst, just ask `Assange <https://www.amazon.com/When-Google-WikiLeaks-Julian-Assange/dp/1944869115>`_!

Facebook, Apple and Microsoft\* are the other evil companies you must stay clear
if you value your anonymity.

\* Unfortunately GitHub joined the dark force. Some might take this repo as 
a way of protesting against the system directly from the enemy's den.

Grand Master level tips
=======================
Combine Tor with a VPN
----------------------

Use Tails
---------
Search `Tails <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tails_(operating_system)>`_ with your favorite non-tracking search engine but only when connected to Tor.  

Use a Yagi WiFi antenna
-----------------------
If you are connecting to Tor, you might be the only one in your building that does so and
hence you can be held suspect. This is where the Yagi WiFi antenna might come in handy to 
deflect attention to somewhere else.
